# Roadmap

## v0 — Legitimacy

The first version exists to prove one thing: **that the system can be trusted.**

Not scale. Not speed. Not feature completeness. Trust.

If users don't believe the pipeline is fair, transparent, and resistant to manipulation, nothing else matters. v0 is built around earning that trust.

### What's in v0

- **Issue submission** — users can submit policy concerns in plain text
- **Agent-based canonicalization and clustering** — AI structures and groups submissions
- **Daily agenda publication** — a transparent, auditable list of what people care about
- **Voting** — users vote on which agenda items should trigger action
- **Action drafting** — the system produces action plans from templates
- **Explicit consent execution** — nothing sends without the user approving it
- **Public audit log** — every step is recorded and verifiable

### What's deliberately excluded from v0

- **Autonomous posting** — no actions fire without human approval
- **On-chain execution** — blockchain adds complexity before it adds trust at this stage
- **Global-scale guarantees** — v0 targets a single jurisdiction or community to keep things tractable
- **Delegated automation** — users can't set-and-forget; every action requires a click

These are excluded not because they're bad ideas, but because they introduce trust assumptions that v0 hasn't earned yet.

## After v0

The roadmap beyond v0 depends on what v0 reveals. But the broad direction:

**v1 — Scale.** Distributed agent execution across independent nodes. Support for multiple concurrent communities or jurisdictions. Delegated consent with strict, user-defined limits.

**v2 — Autonomy.** Protocol-level decentralization. The system operates without any single coordinating entity. Governance of the protocol itself becomes a community function.

### Open Questions

- What does "legitimacy" look like concretely? What metrics or signals tell you v0 has earned trust?
- How large should the v0 pilot be? 100 users? 1,000? What's the minimum for meaningful signal?
- What jurisdiction or community is the right first target?
- How do you transition from centralized to decentralized without losing the trust built in v0?
- What's the failure condition? At what point do you conclude the approach doesn't work?
