# Identity Verification & Sybil Resistance Research

Research on identity verification approaches for a civic voting system where people submit concerns and vote on collective action. The system must prevent fake accounts from gaming the agenda while keeping participation accessible—especially for users in authoritarian contexts (Iran) who need anonymity for safety.

---

## 1. Identity Verification Tiers

### Email Verification

**Mechanism:** User provides email address, receives verification link/code.

**Sybil Resistance:** Very low
- Disposable email services (Mailinator, Guerrilla Mail, 10minutemail) make creating addresses trivial
- Estimated 5,000+ known disposable email providers
- By 2026, up to 30% of free-tier signups are generated by fake users [AbstractAPI, 2026]
- Cost to attacker: Effectively zero (free disposable emails, $0.10-0.50 for aged email accounts)

**Mitigations:**
- Block known disposable email domains (requires maintaining blocklist)
- Require aged email accounts (e.g., created >30 days ago)
- Rate limit signups per email domain
- Verification APIs that detect temporary services

**Best for:** Spam reduction, account recovery, communication channel—but NOT as primary sybil defense.

---

### Phone Verification (SMS OTP)

**Mechanism:** User provides phone number, receives SMS code.

**Sybil Resistance:** Low-Medium
- Virtual phone numbers available for $0.10-2.00 each
- SMS verification services sell bulk verifications
- Phone farms exist specifically to bypass OTP
- More friction than email, but determined attackers easily circumvent

**Provider Costs:**
| Provider | Cost per SMS | Cost per Verification |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| AWS SNS  | $0.0065     | -                    |
| Twilio   | $0.0075     | +$0.05 per success   |
| Telnyx   | varies      | $0.03 per success    |
| Nexmo    | $0.0065     | -                    |

**User Experience Impact:**
- **64% of mobile users refuse SMS OTP** citing poor UX combined with security concerns [IPification, 2024]
- Adds significant friction on mobile
- International SMS delivery unreliable
- Users without phones excluded

**CRITICAL: Iran Surveillance Risk:**
Phone numbers are severe surveillance vectors in Iran. The SIAM system (Subscriber Identity Module Access Management) gives authorities:
- Real-time location tracking of individuals
- Call and SMS metadata monitoring
- Communication pattern analysis
- Ability to slow/disrupt data connections
- SIM card deactivation as punishment

Leaked documents from Iranian cellular carriers reveal this is "not a surveillance system but rather a repression and control system" [The Intercept/Citizen Lab, 2023].

**Recommendation:** Do NOT require phone verification for Iranian users. Phone numbers should be optional and users must understand the risk.

---

### Social Account Linking (OAuth)

**Mechanism:** User authenticates via Twitter/X, GitHub, Google, etc.

**Sybil Resistance:** Low-Medium (varies by platform)

| Platform | Account Creation Cost | Sybil Resistance |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Twitter/X | Free, easy | Low—bot networks rampant |
| GitHub | Free, but activity visible | Medium—aged accounts with history harder to fake |
| Google | Free, phone optional | Low-Medium |
| LinkedIn | Free, phone often required | Medium |
| Facebook | Free, phone often required | Low—massive fake account problem |

**Key Limitation:** OAuth only proves someone controls an account, not that they're a unique human. Attackers can:
- Buy aged accounts ($5-50 depending on platform/age/activity)
- Create accounts in bulk over time
- Transfer verified accounts to bots post-verification

**Enhanced Signals Available:**
- Account creation date (filter for accounts >1 year old)
- Activity history (followers, contributions, posts)
- Account standing (verification status, strikes)

**Best for:** Friction reduction for users with existing accounts; account age/activity as supplemental signal.

---

### Government ID / KYC

**Mechanism:** User uploads government-issued ID; verified by provider.

**Sybil Resistance:** High
- Requires legal identity document
- Costs attackers significantly more to obtain fake IDs
- Third-party verification services detect forged documents

**Costs:** $1-5+ per verification through providers like Jumio, Onfido, Persona.

**Problems:**
- **Excludes vulnerable populations:** Undocumented, refugees, those avoiding government contact
- **Surveillance vector:** Creates database linking real identity to platform activity
- **Dangerous in authoritarian contexts:** Direct link between criticism and legal identity
- **Onboarding abandonment:** 43-68% of users abandon KYC flows [Jumio, 2024]

**When Appropriate:**
- Financial applications with legal requirements
- High-stakes governance with legal standing
- NOT for civic participation in authoritarian contexts

**Recommendation:** Avoid KYC for v0. Consider as optional "enhanced trust" tier later if needed, never required for basic participation.

---

### W3C Verifiable Credentials

**Mechanism:** Cryptographically signed attestations following W3C standards. Issuer creates credential → Holder stores it → Verifier checks it.

**Sybil Resistance:** Depends on issuer

**Key Features:**
- Decentralized—holder controls when/where to present
- Privacy-preserving—selective disclosure possible
- Tamper-evident—cryptographic signatures
- Interoperable—open standard

**Current Limitations:**
- Ecosystem still maturing
- Few non-government issuers with wide adoption
- Requires user to manage credential wallet
- Chicken-and-egg: few issuers because few verifiers, few verifiers because few issuers

**Future Potential:** Good long-term standard for portable identity attestations, but ecosystem not ready for v0 launch.

---

### Biometric (Worldcoin/World ID)

**Mechanism:** Iris scan via "Orb" device creates cryptographic proof of uniqueness.

**Sybil Resistance:** Very High
- Biometric uniqueness enforced at protocol level
- Cannot create multiple accounts without multiple irises
- Zero-knowledge proofs prevent cross-application tracking

**Privacy Model:**
- No personal information required (no name, email, etc.)
- ZK proofs make it "mathematically impossible" to link usage across apps
- User can delete data

**Concerns:**
- **Irreversible data:** Biometrics can't be changed if compromised
- **Centralized trust:** Must trust Worldcoin's Orb and processing
- **Access:** Requires in-person scan at Orb location
- **Regulatory scrutiny:** Multiple countries investigating
- **Power concentration:** Single entity controls verification infrastructure

**Geographic Availability:** Limited Orb locations globally; likely no access in Iran.

**Recommendation:** Interesting for future integration as optional "verified human" tier, but too centralized and access-limited for v0.

---

## 2. Sybil Resistance Without KYC

### Gitcoin Passport / Human Passport

**Mechanism:** Users collect "stamps" (attestations) from multiple sources. Combined stamps generate a score.

**How It Works:**
1. User connects wallet
2. Links various accounts/proofs (Twitter, GitHub, Google, ENS, etc.)
3. Each stamp weighted differently
4. Total score calculated
5. Applications set threshold (commonly 20+ points)

**Scoring:**
- Maximum possible: 100 points
- Common threshold: 20 points
- Different stamps have different weights

**Example Stamps:**
- Social accounts (Twitter, GitHub, Discord, Google)
- Web3 activity (ENS domains, NFT holdings, DAO participation)
- Verification services (BrightID, Civic)
- On-chain history (transaction history, account age)

**Strengths:**
- No single point of failure—compromise one stamp, others still count
- Progressive verification—users add stamps over time
- Privacy-preserving—ZK proofs possible
- Open ecosystem—multiple stamp providers

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires crypto wallet (barrier for non-crypto users)
- Web3-centric stamps exclude mainstream users
- Determined attackers can farm multiple stamps
- Score thresholds are somewhat arbitrary

**Applicability:** Good model for combining multiple weak signals into stronger verification. Could adapt approach without crypto dependency.

---

### BrightID

**Mechanism:** Social graph-based proof of uniqueness through verified human connections.

**How It Works:**
1. User creates BrightID
2. Joins groups of people who know each other (minimum 3)
3. Attends "connection parties" via Zoom to meet verified "Hosts"
4. Host confirms user is real human on video
5. Connection strength between groups provides verification

**Verification Levels:**
- **Meets Verification:** Attended video call, met Host, made connection
- **Bitu Verification:** Graph-based score from "already known" connections with verified users

**Current Scale:** 70,000+ users, 15 integrated apps.

**Strengths:**
- No biometric data collection
- No personal information required
- Open source
- Decentralized verification

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires existing verified users (bootstrapping problem)
- Video calls may be difficult in authoritarian contexts
- Small network effects currently
- Time-intensive verification process

**Applicability:** Interesting model for building trusted communities, but bootstrapping challenge for new platforms.

---

### Proof of Humanity (PoH)

**Mechanism:** Video submission + social vouching + challenge period.

**How It Works:**
1. User submits name, photo, and video
2. Existing members vouch for newcomer
3. 3.5-day challenge period where anyone can dispute
4. If unchallenged, profile registered

**Strengths:**
- Decentralized—no central authority
- Peer verification distributes trust
- Challenge mechanism catches fraudulent submissions
- Creates sybil-resistant registry

**Weaknesses:**
- Video submission may expose identity
- Vouching requires existing network
- Challenge period delays access
- Video/photo creates biometric record

**Applicability:** Challenge period model interesting; video submission problematic for privacy-sensitive users.

---

### Social Graph Analysis

**Mechanism:** Analyze relationship patterns to identify fake account clusters.

**Detection Approaches:**
- **Trust propagation:** Real accounts connected to other real accounts
- **Graph structure analysis:** Fake accounts cluster together, have different connection patterns
- **TrustGCN:** Graph Convolutional Networks for sybil detection
- **SybilFuse:** Combines local attributes with global network structure—98% detection on Twitter (20M nodes)

**Indicators of Sybil Accounts:**
- Few connections to "known good" accounts
- Connections primarily to other new/suspicious accounts
- Unusual clustering patterns
- Similar creation times among connected accounts

**Limitations:**
- Requires sufficient network data
- Attackers can slowly integrate into legitimate networks
- New legitimate users look similar to new fake users
- False positives impact real users

**Applicability:** Useful as supplemental detection layer once platform has meaningful social graph.

---

### Behavioral Analysis

**Mechanism:** Analyze usage patterns to distinguish humans from bots/coordinated attacks.

**Signals:**
- Posting timing patterns (bots often post at regular intervals)
- Content diversity (bots repeat similar content)
- Interaction patterns (bots engage differently than humans)
- Session characteristics (mouse movements, typing patterns)
- Device fingerprinting

**Strengths:**
- Invisible to users
- Continuous assessment
- Difficult to perfectly mimic human behavior
- Can detect coordinated campaigns

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires sufficient activity to assess
- Privacy implications of detailed tracking
- Sophisticated attackers can mimic human behavior
- False positives punish legitimate users

**Applicability:** Good supplemental layer; should not be sole defense.

---

### Economic Costs (Stake to Participate)

**Mechanism:** Require economic commitment to participate.

**Approaches:**
- Pay-to-register fees
- Refundable deposits
- Token staking
- Proof of burn

**Effectiveness:**
- Creates direct cost for sybil accounts
- If 1000 fake accounts cost $10,000, fewer attackers can afford it
- Refundable deposits reduce attacker cost (they get it back)

**Quadratic Voting Economics:**
- Cost of N votes = N² credits
- Distributing votes across sybil accounts gives linear cost
- Single account expressing intensity costs quadratically more
- Incentivizes using fewer accounts (counterintuitively helps sybil)

**Problems:**
- Excludes low-income users
- Cryptocurrency requirements add complexity
- Payment processing adds friction
- May conflict with civic participation goals

**Applicability:** Consider small, refundable deposits for high-impact actions. Avoid for basic participation.

---

## 3. Authoritarian Context Considerations

### Phone Number Risks in Iran

**SIAM System Capabilities:**
- Real-time location tracking (individual and group)
- Communication metadata collection (who, when, where)
- Call content interception with encryption breaking
- Data connection manipulation (slowdown, disruption)
- SIM deactivation as punishment

**SIM Deactivation Consequences:**
- Loss of banking access
- Loss of educational platform access
- Social isolation
- Must visit security offices to restore service

**Implication:** Any system requiring phone verification is unsafe for Iranian activists.

---

### GAMAAN Approach (Iran Polling)

GAMAAN (Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran) uses "anonymity sampling" for surveys in authoritarian contexts:

**Key Principles:**
1. **No personally identifying information collected**
2. **Multiple distribution channels:** Social media, satellite TV, VPN providers
3. **Chain referral sampling:** Organic sharing through networks
4. **Real-time demographic monitoring:** Adjust outreach to reach underrepresented groups
5. **Large sample sizes:** Tens of thousands of respondents

**Why This Works:**
- Addresses "preference falsification" (fear-of-state bias)
- No phone numbers or real names required
- Distributed through channels already used to bypass censorship
- Statistical validity through volume

**Applicability:** Model for reaching Iranian users through existing trusted channels (Telegram, VPNs, satellite).

---

### Pseudonymous Participation with Sybil Resistance

**The Challenge:** Verify "real person" without exposing identity.

**Possible Approaches:**

1. **Vouching Networks:**
   - Trusted community members vouch for newcomers
   - Voucher's reputation at stake
   - Works well for diaspora communities with existing trust networks

2. **Reputation Over Time:**
   - New users have limited capabilities
   - Positive contributions unlock more privileges
   - Long-term accounts more costly to fake than to earn

3. **Proof of Effort:**
   - Require meaningful contribution before voting privileges
   - Quality submissions demonstrate human engagement
   - Time investment creates cost for attackers

4. **Multi-Signal Scoring (adapted Passport model):**
   - Telegram account age (not phone number)
   - Email account age (not email content)
   - Social account existence (not linking identity across platforms)
   - Behavioral signals over time
   - Optional vouching from trusted members

5. **Device/Browser Fingerprinting:**
   - Detect same device creating multiple accounts
   - Privacy-preserving approaches exist (hash fingerprints)
   - Effectiveness varies; sophisticated attackers rotate devices

---

## 4. Verification Friction Research

### Registration Drop-off Rates

| Verification Method | Completion Rate | Drop-off |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Passwordless/magic link | 87.9% | 12.1% |
| Password-based | 64.2% | 35.8% |
| KYC/ID verification | 32-57% | 43-68% |
| SMS OTP (mobile) | ~36% | ~64% |

**Key Findings:**
- Each authentication step reduces conversion by 10-15%
- 60% of users report being "slowed down or blocked" by authentication
- Mobile users face 2-3x lower conversion than desktop
- 43% abandon due to identity verification friction specifically

---

### Mobile-Specific Challenges

- Smaller screens increase error rates
- Typing friction higher
- SMS delivery delays frustrate users
- International SMS unreliable
- 64% of mobile users refuse SMS OTP

**Mobile Best Practices:**
- Magic link/passwordless authentication
- OAuth with existing accounts
- Minimize form fields
- Progressive disclosure (don't ask everything upfront)

---

### Verification Friction by Method

| Method | User Time | Technical Complexity | Sybil Resistance |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Email magic link | <30 sec | Low | Very Low |
| Email + disposable blocking | <30 sec | Medium | Low |
| Social OAuth | <15 sec | Low | Low-Medium |
| SMS OTP | 1-2 min | Medium | Low-Medium |
| Phone call verification | 2-3 min | High | Medium |
| Document upload (KYC) | 5-15 min | High | High |
| Video verification | 10-30 min | Very High | High |
| Biometric (Worldcoin) | 5+ min (if Orb nearby) | Very High | Very High |

---

## 5. Tiered Participation Models

### Wikipedia Model

**User Tiers:**
1. **Anonymous/unregistered:** Can read; can edit most articles
2. **New account:** Can edit, limited trust
3. **Autoconfirmed:** Account >4 days AND >10 edits → can edit semi-protected pages
4. **Established editor:** Assessed by community based on edit quality, behavior, time
5. **Administrator:** Community-elected, full moderation powers

**Reputation Factors:**
- Number of edits
- Quality of edits (not reverted, constructive)
- Areas of contribution
- Time span of activity
- Social standing (not a sockpuppet, not evading bans)

**Key Insight:** No fixed threshold—reputation is assessed holistically by community.

---

### Stack Overflow Model

**Privilege Unlocks:**
| Reputation | Privilege |
|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Ask questions, post answers |
| 15 | Upvote |
| 50 | Comment everywhere |
| 125 | Downvote |
| 500 | Cast close votes |
| 2,000 | Edit posts without review |
| 3,000 | Cast close/reopen votes |
| 10,000 | Moderator tools |
| 15,000 | Protect questions |

**Reputation Earning:**
- +10 for answer upvote
- +5 for question upvote
- -2 for downvote given
- +15 for accepted answer
- +2 for edit approved

**Anti-Gaming:**
- Targeted voting patterns automatically detected and reversed
- Daily vote limits (30/day)
- Reputation caps per question (200/day)

**Key Insight:** Granular privilege unlocks tied to demonstrated positive contribution.

---

### Proposed Tiered Model for Civic Voting

**Tier 0: Observer**
- Requirements: None
- Capabilities: View concerns, view vote counts, read discussions
- Rationale: Maximum transparency, zero friction

**Tier 1: Contributor**
- Requirements: Email verification (block disposables) + account >24 hours
- Capabilities: Submit concerns, comment, react
- Rationale: Minimal barrier, allows participation while limiting spam

**Tier 2: Voter**
- Requirements: Tier 1 + (social OAuth with account >90 days OR 3+ approved contributions OR vouched by Tier 3 user)
- Capabilities: Full voting on agenda items
- Rationale: Meaningful sybil resistance without KYC; multiple paths to qualify

**Tier 3: Trusted Member**
- Requirements: Tier 2 + (6+ months active participation AND positive standing AND vouched by 2+ Tier 3 users)
- Capabilities: Vouch for new users, moderate submissions, weighted input on disputes
- Rationale: Community-elected trusted contributors

**Iranian User Path:**
- Skip phone verification entirely
- Email with aged account
- Telegram account verification (account age, without phone number exposure)
- Contribution-based reputation
- Vouching from diaspora community members

---

## 6. Recommendations for v0

### Minimum Viable Identity Tier

**Recommended v0 Approach:**

**For Submission (Tier 1):**
- Email verification with disposable email blocking
- Account age minimum (24 hours before first submission)
- Basic rate limiting (max 3 submissions per day)

**For Voting (Tier 2):**
- Email verification (as above) PLUS one of:
  - OAuth with aged social account (Twitter >90 days, GitHub >90 days, Google account)
  - OR 3+ submissions that weren't flagged as spam
  - OR vouching from trusted early user

**Rationale:**
- Low friction for legitimate users
- Multiple paths to voting (doesn't exclude non-social-media users)
- Time-based friction (account age) is free and meaningful
- Contribution-based path rewards engagement
- Vouching enables trusted communities to onboard members

---

### What Can Be Added Later

**Phase 2 Additions:**
- Behavioral analysis (posting patterns, session characteristics)
- Social graph analysis once network develops
- Multi-stamp scoring (adapted Gitcoin Passport model without crypto)
- Optional enhanced verification tier for weighted voting

**Phase 3 Additions:**
- Community reputation system (Wikipedia-style earned standing)
- Cryptographic attestations (W3C VCs when ecosystem matures)
- Optional Worldcoin/biometric integration if access improves
- Economic mechanisms if governance stakes increase

---

### Iranian Participant Considerations

**DO:**
- Accept Telegram account age as verification signal (widely used, already on VPN)
- Distribute through existing trusted channels (diaspora orgs, Telegram communities)
- Allow fully pseudonymous participation
- Enable vouching networks within diaspora
- Build contribution-based reputation paths

**DON'T:**
- Require phone numbers
- Require government ID
- Require video verification
- Store IP addresses long-term
- Create linkable identity across submissions

**Technical Safeguards:**
- Tor-friendly (don't block Tor exit nodes)
- VPN-friendly (don't flag VPN IPs as suspicious)
- No device fingerprinting stored (or hash only)
- Minimize metadata collection
- Clear data retention policies

---

## 7. Implementation Considerations

### Multi-Signal Scoring System

Adapt Gitcoin Passport approach for non-crypto context:

```
Score Components (example weights):
- Email verified (non-disposable): 5 points
- Email account aged >1 year: 5 points
- Social OAuth (aged account): 10 points
- Multiple social accounts: 5 points
- Approved contributions: 5 points each (max 20)
- Vouched by trusted user: 15 points
- Account age >30 days: 5 points
- Account age >180 days: 10 points

Voting threshold: 20 points
```

Multiple paths to threshold:
- Long-time email + social account = 20 points
- New email + social + one contribution = 20 points
- New accounts + multiple contributions + vouch = 25 points

### Rate Limiting Strategy

| Action | Limit | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Account creation | 1/IP/day | Prevent mass registration |
| Submissions | 3/user/day | Quality over quantity |
| Votes | 20/user/day | Allow engagement, prevent flooding |
| Comments | 10/user/hour | Enable discussion, prevent spam |
| Vouching | 1/user/week | Make vouching meaningful |

### Progressive Trust Model

```
Day 1: Can browse, verify email
Day 2: Can submit concerns (limited)
Day 7: Full submission rights
Day 14: Full voting rights (if other criteria met)
Day 30: Can vouch for others (if reputation positive)
Day 180: Trusted contributor status (if sustained positive)
```

## 8. Key Tradeoffs Summary

| Approach | Sybil Resistance | Accessibility | Privacy | Iran-Safe |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Email only | Very Low | Very High | High | Yes |
| Email + disposable blocking | Low | Very High | High | Yes |
| Phone SMS | Low-Medium | Medium | Medium | **NO** |
| Social OAuth | Low-Medium | High | Medium | Partial |
| KYC | High | Low | Very Low | **NO** |
| Biometric (Worldcoin) | Very High | Very Low | Medium | **NO** |
| Multi-signal scoring | Medium | High | High | Yes |
| Contribution reputation | Medium-High | High | High | Yes |
| Vouching networks | Medium | High | High | Yes |
