## 1. Product Overview

### Core Principle: Visibility and Trust

**Trust emerges from visibility, not authority.**

This is the foundational principle of the entire system. Every design decision in this MVP prioritizes:

1. **Visibility** — Users can see exactly what the system did with their input. Every submission, every canonicalization, every cluster assignment, every vote is traceable and publicly verifiable.

2. **Trust through transparency** — The system earns trust not by claiming to be fair, but by proving it. The evidence store, public analytics, and audit trail exist so anyone can verify the pipeline worked correctly.

3. **No hidden decisions** — The AI organizes, but doesn't editorialize. Clustering logic is published. Summaries link to source submissions. Nothing is suppressed.

4. **User sovereignty** — Users can dispute canonicalization, see which cluster their submission joined, verify their vote was counted, and trace the full history.

See [Visibility and Trust](visibility-and-trust.md) for the full technical approach to building verifiable trust.

### How Do I Know You're Not Manipulating the Results?

**Short answer: Don't trust us. Verify.**

| "What if you..." | Our answer |
|------------------|------------|
| ...change my submission? | Your original text is hashed and stored. The canonical form is separate. You can see both and flag if they don't match. |
| ...put me in the wrong cluster? | Every cluster links to its member submissions. Click through and judge for yourself. |
| ...don't count my vote? | Your vote is in the evidence store with a hash. You can verify it's there. The public tally includes it. |
| ...add fake votes? | Every vote links to a verified user. Registration requires email + messaging account verification. |
| ...delete things you don't like? | The evidence store is append-only with a hash chain. Deleting anything breaks the chain — publicly detectable. |
| ...bias the AI clustering? | We run clustering multiple times and flag variance. You can see the "why grouped" explanation for every cluster. |

**What we can't fully prevent in v0** (honest limitations):
- Operators with database access could theoretically insert fake users (solution: federation in v2)
- AI clustering could have subtle bias (solution: multi-run analysis, external audits)
- You have to trust our code is doing what we say (solution: open source, independent review)

**The v0 promise**: We publish everything. If we're cheating, you can catch us.

### Core Value Proposition

Iranians don't know what other Iranians want. The regime controls public discourse, diaspora is fragmented, and no neutral platform surfaces collective preferences. Collective Will v0 answers: **"What do we, as a people, actually want?"**

### User Story

> As an Iranian (inside or diaspora), I want to express what I care about and see what others care about, so I can understand where consensus exists and feel connected to a collective voice.

### Success Metrics (v0)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Registered users | >500 in first 3 months |
| Submissions | >200 unique policy concerns |
| Voting participation | >30% of registered users vote |
| Return visits (website) | >20% visit analytics weekly |
| **Trust: Fair representation** | >70% say clustering "fairly represents" their view |
| **Trust: Dispute rate** | <10% of users flag canonicalization as wrong |
| **Trust: Audit usage** | >5% of users check their submission trail |

### Module Boundaries

| Module | Responsibility | Talks To |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Messaging Gateway** | Receive/send messages, normalize across platforms | Pipeline, Database |
| **Processing Pipeline** | Canonicalize, cluster, build agenda | Database |
| **Core Database** | Store all data, provide queries | All modules |
| **Public Website** | Display analytics, user dashboard | Database (read-only) |
| **Evidence Store** | Append-only audit trail | Embedded in Database |

---

## 3. Module Breakdown

### 3.1 Messaging Gateway

**Purpose**: Interface with WhatsApp (primary), Telegram, Signal. Normalize messages into common format.

**Technology Choice**: **Direct channel integrations (Python)**

**Why direct integrations over a framework (like OpenClaw)**:
- Full control over code that runs — critical for a civic platform with security/trust requirements
- No framework lock-in or unexpected upstream changes
- Simpler architecture — only the code we need, nothing more
- Better auditability — every line is ours to inspect and explain
- Python ecosystem for AI/clustering is superior

**Channel libraries**:
- **WhatsApp**: Evolution API (self-hosted gateway) — handles Baileys complexity, exposes REST/webhooks
- **Telegram**: python-telegram-bot — mature, well-documented, 25k+ stars
- **Signal**: signal-cli + signal-bot wrapper — signal-cli is the actively maintained option

**Key Components**:

```
src/
├── channels/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py              # Abstract channel interface
│   ├── whatsapp.py          # Evolution API client
│   ├── telegram.py          # python-telegram-bot wrapper
│   ├── signal.py            # signal-cli wrapper
│   └── types.py             # Unified message format
├── handlers/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── intake.py            # Receives submissions
│   ├── voting.py            # Sends vote prompts, receives votes
│   └── notifications.py     # Sends updates to users
├── middleware/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── audit.py             # Log to evidence store
│   └── validation.py        # Input validation
└── config.py
```

**Design Decisions**:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Primary channel | WhatsApp | 81% of Iranians use VPNs; WhatsApp restrictions lifted Dec 2024 |
| Account verification | Link existing account (not phone number) | Telegram/WhatsApp account age provides some sybil resistance without phone exposure |
| Message format | Plain text, Farsi primary | Lowest friction; LLM handles translation |
| Session management | Stateless per-message | Simpler; state lives in database |

**WhatsApp Business API: Medium Risk (Acceptable)**

WhatsApp Business API requires Meta business verification, but this is **not a high-risk exposure**:
- Meta verification is NOT public record (unlike domain WHOIS)
- Iranian government cannot subpoena Meta (no jurisdiction)
- You're one of millions of Business API users
- No public link between your identity and the project

This is the same risk level as using Anthropic's API — acceptable for MVP.

**Setup options:**
1. **Direct registration** with Meta Business (credit card OK)
2. **Via BSP** like Twilio or MessageBird (one step removed)

See [operational-security.md](operational-security.md) for the full risk-tier framework.

### 3.2 Processing Pipeline

**Purpose**: Transform raw submissions into clustered policy positions.

**Sub-modules**:

#### 3.2.1 Canonicalization Agent

**Input**: Raw message text (Farsi or English)
**Output**: Structured `PolicyCandidate`

**Technology**: 
- **Model**: Anthropic Claude or Mistral API (cloud)
- **Data separation**: Only anonymous text sent to API; user IDs and metadata never leave local infrastructure

**Processing Steps**:
1. Store raw submission locally with user link (never sent to cloud)
2. Extract text only, strip all metadata
3. Batch submissions, shuffle order (breaks timing correlation)
4. Send anonymous text to cloud LLM for canonicalization
5. Detect language (Farsi, English, Kurdish, etc.)
6. Extract policy concern(s) — may yield multiple candidates from one message
7. Structure into `PolicyCandidate` schema
8. Compute semantic embedding locally (CPU)
9. Store structured result, link back to original submission

**Prompt Strategy**:
```
You are a policy structuring assistant. Given a user's freeform concern, 
extract structured policy positions WITHOUT editorializing.

Rules:
- Preserve the user's intent exactly
- Do not add opinions or framing
- If the message contains multiple distinct concerns, output multiple candidates
- Flag uncertainty rather than guessing

Output JSON schema: {PolicyCandidate}
```

**Design Decisions**:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| LLM location | Cloud (Anthropic/Mistral) | Simpler infrastructure for MVP; revisit at scale |
| Data separation | Text-only to cloud, user links stay local | Protects user identity while enabling AI processing |
| Multi-issue handling | Split into separate candidates | Research shows joint prediction works; preserves granularity |
| Language | Process in original language, translate for display | Preserves nuance; translation happens at display time |
| Confidence threshold | <0.7 confidence → flag for review | Better to surface uncertainty than silently fail |
| Schema rigidity | Hybrid (required core + flexible extensions) | Balance between consistency and expressiveness |

#### 3.2.2 Clustering Agent

**Input**: Set of `PolicyCandidate` records with embeddings
**Output**: `Cluster` records with summaries

**Technology**:
- **Embeddings**: `multilingual-e5-large` (local, CPU) — stays local for privacy; CPU sufficient for batch processing at MVP scale
- **Clustering**: HDBSCAN (density-based, no need to specify K) — runs locally
- **Summarization**: Anthropic Claude or Mistral API (cloud) — receives only aggregated/anonymized cluster content, not individual submissions

**Processing Steps**:
1. Load all candidates from current cycle (or delta since last run)
2. Compute/retrieve embeddings
3. Run HDBSCAN clustering
4. For each cluster:
   - Generate representative summary via LLM
   - Compute cluster statistics (size, diversity)
   - Link member candidates
5. Store clusters with audit trail

**Run Schedule**: 
- **Batch**: Every 6 hours
- **Future**: Consider incremental updates as volume grows

**Design Decisions**:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Clustering algorithm | HDBSCAN | No need to specify K; handles varying densities |
| Granularity control | `min_cluster_size=5` | Prevent micro-clusters; can tune based on feedback |
| Multi-run variance | Run 3x, flag high-variance clusters | Detect instability before publishing |
| Reproducibility | Log random seed, HDBSCAN params, prompt version, and run ID per cycle | If challenged, anyone can re-run the exact pipeline |
| Small clusters | Show all (no suppression) | Transparency principle; minorities visible |

#### 3.2.3 Agenda Builder

**Input**: Clusters from current cycle
**Output**: Voting agenda (subset of clusters)

**Logic for v0**: Simple — all clusters above minimum size go to voting. No editorial selection.

**Future considerations**:
- Diversity weighting (geographic, demographic)
- Recency vs. sustained interest
- Topic balancing

---

### 3.3 Core Database

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all application data.

**Technology Choice**: **PostgreSQL**

**Why PostgreSQL**:
- Mature, reliable, well-understood
- JSONB for flexible schema fields
- Full-text search for Farsi (with `pg_trgm` or external index)
- Extensions: `pgvector` for embedding similarity search
- Easy to backup, replicate, audit

**Schema Overview**:

```sql
-- See Section 4 for full data models

-- Core tables
users
submissions
policy_candidates
clusters
votes
voting_cycles

-- Audit/evidence
evidence_log (append-only)
```

**Evidence Store Implementation**:

For v0, embed evidence store in PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE evidence_log (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    entity_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    hash TEXT NOT NULL,           -- SHA-256 of payload
    prev_hash TEXT NOT NULL,      -- Hash of previous entry (chain)
    
    -- Immutability enforced by:
    -- 1. No UPDATE/DELETE permissions on this table
    -- 2. Trigger that validates hash chain on INSERT
);

-- Index for verification queries
CREATE INDEX idx_evidence_hash ON evidence_log(hash);
CREATE INDEX idx_evidence_entity ON evidence_log(entity_type, entity_id);
```

**Witness.co Integration** (optional for v0):
- Daily job: compute Merkle root of day's evidence entries
- Submit root to Witness.co for Ethereum anchoring
- Store anchor receipt in evidence_log

**Design Decisions**:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Database | PostgreSQL | Mature, pgvector for embeddings, JSONB flexibility |
| Evidence store | Embedded hash-chain table | Simpler than separate system; sufficient for v0 scale |
| Blockchain anchoring | Optional via Witness.co | External tamper evidence without running infrastructure |
| Embedding storage | pgvector extension | Keep embeddings with data; similarity search built-in |

---

### 3.4 Public Website

**Purpose**: Display analytics, allow subscription, show user dashboard.

**Technology Choice**: **Next.js** (TypeScript)

**Why Next.js**:
- SSR for public analytics (SEO, fast initial load)
- React for interactive dashboards
- API routes for subscription flow
- TypeScript for type safety across data models
- Large ecosystem, easy to find developers

**Pages**:

```
# Core trust loop (ship first)
/                           # Landing + subscribe CTA
/analytics                  # Public dashboard (no login required)
/analytics/clusters         # Cluster explorer with drill-down
/dashboard                  # Logged-in user's personal view
/dashboard/submissions      # My submissions and their fate
/dashboard/votes            # My votes
/verify                     # Email/messaging verification flow
/about                      # Mission, methodology, team
/audit                      # Evidence explorer (technical users)

# Post-launch enhancements
/analytics/trends           # Time-series of policy interest
```

**Analytics Dashboard Components**:

*Core trust loop (ship first):*
1. **Cluster Explorer** — list of clusters with size, click to drill into summary + member submissions (anonymized)
2. **Submission Verification** — authenticated users can confirm their submission exists and trace its journey
3. **Audit Evidence Viewer** — hash chain explorer for technical users
4. **Top Policies** — ranked list with vote counts

*Post-launch enhancements:*
5. **Policy Landscape** — treemap or bubble chart of clusters by size
6. **Trends** — time-series of policy interest over cycles
7. **Recent Activity** — stream of anonymized submissions
8. **Demographic Breakdown** — if collected (deferred; privacy concerns)

**Design Decisions**:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) | SSR for public pages, React for dashboards |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Rapid development, consistent design |
| Charts | Recharts or D3 | Flexible, well-documented |
| i18n | next-intl | Farsi RTL support built-in |
| Auth | NextAuth.js with email magic links | Simple, no password management |

**Internationalization**:

- Primary: Farsi (RTL)
- Secondary: English
- UI chrome in both languages
- User-generated content displayed in original language with optional translation toggle

### 3.5 Voting Service

**Purpose**: Manage voting cycles, collect votes, tally results.

**Implementation**: Part of Messaging Gateway + Database

**Flow**:
1. Agenda Builder produces voting agenda
2. Voting Service creates `VotingCycle` record
3. Messaging Gateway sends vote prompts to all verified users
4. Users reply with votes (via messaging app)
5. Votes recorded in database
6. Cycle closes (time-based or threshold)
7. Results computed and published

**Voting Mechanism for v0**: **Approval Voting**

- User sees list of policies in current cycle
- User can approve any number (including zero)
- Final score = count of approvals
- Simple, understandable, no strategic complexity

**Message Format**:
```
🗳️ صندوق رای باز است!

این هفته، این سیاست‌ها مطرح شدند:

1. [Policy summary in Farsi]
2. [Policy summary in Farsi]
3. [Policy summary in Farsi]

برای رای دادن، شماره‌های موردنظر خود را بفرستید.
مثال: 1, 3

برای انصراف: "انصراف" بفرستید
```

**Design Decisions**:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Mechanism | Approval voting | Simple, no vote-splitting, universally understood |
| Cycle duration | 48 hours | Long enough for global participation across timezones |
| Reminders | 1 reminder at 24h remaining | Balance engagement vs. annoyance |
| Minimum participation | No threshold for v0 | Learn what natural participation looks like first |

## 6. Technology Stack

### 6.1 Summary

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Messaging Gateway** | Python (FastAPI) | Direct channel control, unified codebase with pipeline |
| **AI Pipeline** | Python | Best ML ecosystem (transformers, HDBSCAN, scikit-learn) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + pgvector | Mature, embeddings, JSONB |
| **Website** | Next.js (TypeScript) | SSR, React, good i18n |
| **Hosting** | Single VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean) | Simple, cheap, EU-based for GDPR |
| **Cloud LLM** | Anthropic Claude or Mistral API | EU/US providers with strong privacy posture |
| **Embeddings** | multilingual-e5-large (local, CPU) | Stays local for privacy; CPU sufficient at MVP scale |

**LLM Strategy**: Cloud-first for MVP. Local GPU infrastructure deferred until critical mass justifies the complexity. See [Section 7.3](#73-why-cloud-first-for-mvp) for rationale and data separation approach.

### 6.2 Language Choices

**Python** for (primary language):
- Messaging Gateway (FastAPI + channel libraries)
- AI Pipeline (canonicalization, clustering)
- Best ecosystem: transformers, sentence-transformers, hdbscan, scikit-learn
- python-telegram-bot, httpx for Evolution API
- Unified codebase — simpler deployment, shared utilities

**TypeScript** for:
- Website (Next.js) — SSR benefits, React ecosystem
- Frontend components

**Why Python-first**:
- Clustering and embeddings are core to the pipeline — Python owns this space
- AI/LLM libraries are Python-first (Anthropic SDK, sentence-transformers)
- More readable/auditable — important for civic trust
- Single backend language simplifies deployment and maintenance
- Channel integrations work well in Python (python-telegram-bot is excellent)

**Shared**:
- Data models defined in Python (Pydantic), exported as JSON Schema for TypeScript
- Database is source of truth

### 6.3 Python Security & Best Practices

Python is chosen for its excellent ML/AI ecosystem and readability. We treat dependencies as a liability to manage.

#### Dependency Security

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Minimal dependencies** | Every pip package is a risk; justify each one |
| **Lock versions** | Use `uv.lock` or `poetry.lock`; pin exact versions |
| **Audit regularly** | Run `pip-audit` or `safety` in CI; block deploys on critical vulns |
| **Avoid deep trees** | Prefer packages with few transitive dependencies |
| **Virtual environments** | Always use venv/uv; never install globally |

#### Memory Management

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Stream large data** | Use generators/iterators; don't load full evidence store into memory |
| **Connection pooling** | Use SQLAlchemy connection pools; configure pool size appropriately |
| **Profile under load** | Test with realistic message volume before launch |
| **Set timeouts** | All external calls (DB, API) have timeouts via `httpx` or `asyncio.timeout` |
| **Async where appropriate** | Use `asyncio` for I/O-bound operations (API calls, DB queries) |

#### Secure Coding Practices

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Type hints** | Use type hints everywhere; run `mypy` in strict mode |
| **Input validation** | Validate all user input with Pydantic; never trust messaging payloads |
| **No eval/exec** | Never execute dynamic code |
| **Parameterized queries** | Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries; no string concatenation for SQL |
| **Secrets management** | Environment variables only; never in code; rotate regularly |
| **Rate limiting** | Use FastAPI middleware or `slowapi`; prevent abuse |

#### Crypto Operations

| Operation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Hashing (evidence store)** | Use Python built-in `hashlib` (C bindings); SHA-256 for evidence chain |
| **Future: signatures** | Use `cryptography` library (well-audited) or call Rust service |
| **Random generation** | Use `secrets` module, not `random` |

#### Code Quality

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **ruff** | Fast linting and formatting |
| **mypy** | Static type checking |
| **pytest** | Testing |
| **pre-commit** | Enforce checks before commit |

#### Migration Path (If Needed at Scale)

If we reach scale where Python becomes a bottleneck:

1. **Evidence store service** → Rewrite in Rust (crypto operations, append-only log)
2. **Hot paths** → Rewrite specific endpoints in Go/Rust if profiling shows need
3. **Keep Python for** → AI pipeline, clustering, LLM integration (Python wins here)

Design interfaces now (via API boundaries) so these rewrites are possible without full system redesign.

```bash
# Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+ (for website only)
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Docker (optional, for easy setup)
- uv (recommended) or pip for Python dependency management

# Quick start
docker-compose up -d postgres      # Start database
uv sync                            # Install Python dependencies
alembic upgrade head               # Run migrations
uv run python -m src.api.main      # Start FastAPI backend

# In another terminal (for website):
cd web && pnpm install && pnpm dev

# Or run everything with Docker:
docker-compose up -d

# Individual services:
uv run python -m src.api.main      # API server
uv run python -m src.scheduler     # Background jobs
cd web && pnpm dev                 # Website
```

### 6.6 Production Deployment

**Single-server deployment for v0** (simplicity over scale).

> **📖 See [Infrastructure Guide](infrastructure-guide.md)** for complete step-by-step setup instructions.

**Architecture Summary:**

```
Internet → Cloudflare (DNS/CDN) → Hetzner VPS
                                      │
                    ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
                    │                 │                 │

                    │               │                 │
                    │               └────────┬────────┘
                    │                        ▼
                    │                    postgres
                    │                   (pgvector)
                    │                        │
                    └──► scheduler ──────────┘
                        (background jobs)
```

**Recommended Setup:**

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Provider | **Hetzner Cloud** (EU jurisdiction, privacy-friendly) |
| Plan | CX32 (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 80GB SSD) |
| Location | Falkenstein or Helsinki (EU) |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| Deployment | Docker Compose |

**Why Hetzner over AWS:**
- **EU jurisdiction** (Germany) — strong privacy laws, no US CLOUD Act
- **5-10× cheaper** for equivalent specs
- **Simple pricing** — no surprise bills
- **Sufficient for MVP** — handles <1000 concurrent users easily

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| VPS (Hetzner CX32) | €8.50 (~$9) |
| Backup storage (100GB) | €3 (~$3) |
| LLM API (Anthropic/Mistral) | $5-15 |
| Domain (amortized) | ~$1 |
| DNS/CDN (Cloudflare) | Free |
| SSL (Let's Encrypt) | Free |
| **Total** | **~$20-30/month** |

**Infrastructure Guide covers:**
- [ ] Server provisioning and SSH setup
- [ ] Docker installation and configuration  
- [ ] Domain, DNS (Cloudflare), and HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Database access methods (SSH tunnel, GUI tools)
- [ ] Automated backup strategy
- [ ] Security hardening (firewall, fail2ban, etc.)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

**Future scaling**: When volume exceeds ~10K submissions/month, consider dedicated server with GPU for local LLM inference.

## 7. Design Decisions

### 7.0 Visibility and Trust as Non-Negotiable

Every feature in v0 is filtered through one question: **"Can a user verify this?"**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Every input is preserved** | Raw submissions stored with hash; never modified |
| **Every AI decision is logged** | Canonicalization, clustering logged to evidence store with model version |
| **Every cluster is traceable** | Click any cluster → see member submissions |
| **Every vote is verifiable** | User can see their vote in dashboard; aggregate tallies are public |
| **No suppression** | All clusters shown, even small ones; no editorial filtering |
| **Public by default** | Analytics visible to anyone; no login wall for transparency |

This is why we have an evidence store, why clustering shows "why these were grouped," why users can flag bad canonicalization, and why the audit explorer exists.

**If we can't make it visible, we don't build it.**

---

### 7.0.1 Contributor Safety and Anonymity

**The problem**: Contributors may have family in Iran. If identity is linked to this project, families could face pressure.

**The principle**: The key is **publicly discoverable** vs **requires subpoena**. Use privacy-focused providers; credit card is fine.

| Vector | Risk | Approach |
|--------|------|----------|
| Regular domain registrar | **High** | Your name in WHOIS — DON'T USE |
| Regular hosting (Hetzner) | **High** | Identity verified — DON'T USE |
| Git commits with real name | **High** | Permanent in history — USE PSEUDONYM |
| GitHub with real identity | **High** | Public profile — USE PSEUDONYM |
| Njalla domain | Medium | WHOIS shows Njalla — credit card OK |
| Njalla/1984.is hosting | Medium | Privacy jurisdiction — credit card OK |
| WhatsApp Business API | Medium | Not public — credit card OK |
| LLM API accounts | Medium | Not public — credit card OK |

**Key insight**: The protection comes from **using privacy-focused registrar/host** (Njalla, 1984.is), not from paying with crypto. Credit card is acceptable.

**MVP requirements**:
- Domain + hosting via Njalla or 1984.is (credit card OK)
- Pseudonymous identity for code (git, GitHub, public comms)
- Regular accounts OK for WhatsApp, LLM APIs, dev tools

See **[Operational Security Guide](operational-security.md)** for implementation details.

**Long-term goal**: Decentralize so project can run without any single identity exposure point.

---

### 7.1 Why Direct Channel Integrations (Not a Framework)

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|-------------|------|------|----------|
| **OpenClaw** | Ready integrations, agent model | Framework lock-in, TypeScript, security model for personal use not civic platforms | ❌ |
| **Automagik Omni** | Multi-channel hub, Python | Newer project, another dependency | ❌ |
| **Twilio + custom** | Well-documented API | Higher cost, vendor dependency | ❌ |
| **Direct libraries** | Full control, Python-native, auditable | Some integration work | ✅ |

**Why we chose direct integrations:**
- **Security**: Full control over what code runs — critical for civic trust
- **Auditability**: Every line is ours to inspect and explain
- **Simplicity**: Only the code we need, no framework ecosystem
- **Python ecosystem**: Unified codebase with AI/clustering pipeline
- **No upstream risk**: Framework changes don't affect us

**Channel-specific choices:**
- **WhatsApp**: Evolution API (self-hosted gateway) wraps Baileys complexity, exposes clean REST/webhooks
- **Telegram**: python-telegram-bot — excellent library, 25k+ stars, well-maintained
- **Signal**: signal-cli + Python wrapper — the actively maintained option for Signal bots

### 7.2 Why PostgreSQL (not specialized stores)

| Alternative | Use Case | Why Not for v0 |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Kafka** | Append-only log | Overkill; hash-chain in Postgres sufficient |
| **MongoDB** | Flexible schema | Postgres JSONB is enough; lose ACID |
| **Pinecone** | Vector search | pgvector sufficient; one less service |
| **Redis** | Caching | Premature optimization |

### 7.3 Why Cloud-First for MVP

| Approach | Infra Cost | LLM Cost (1K submissions) | Complexity |
|----------|------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **GPU server + local LLM** | ~$150-200/mo | ~$0.50 | High (GPU procurement, vLLM setup, model management) |
| **VPS + cloud LLM** | ~$50/mo | ~$5-15 | Low (standard VPS, API calls) |

**Decision**: Cloud-first for MVP. At 500 users / ~200 submissions, API costs are negligible (~$5-15/month). GPU infrastructure complexity is not justified until we reach critical mass.

**When to revisit**: Consider local LLM infrastructure when:
- Submission volume exceeds ~10K/month (cost crossover)
- Privacy requirements escalate (e.g., government partnership)
- Latency becomes critical (real-time processing needed)

#### Data Separation Strategy

The key concern with cloud LLMs is privacy for users inside Iran whose political views could be dangerous if exposed.

**What stays local (never sent to cloud):**
- User identifiers and account information
- Submission-to-user mapping
- Timing metadata that could correlate submissions
- Raw embeddings (computed locally on CPU)

**What goes to cloud LLM (anonymized):**
- Submission text only (stripped of all context)
- Batched and shuffled to break timing correlation
- Cluster summaries (aggregated content, not individual voices)

**Provider selection criteria:**
| Provider | Jurisdiction | Data Handling | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Anthropic Claude** | US | No training on API data, SOC2 | ✅ Good for MVP |
| **Mistral** | France/EU | EU data residency, GDPR compliant | ✅ Good for MVP |
| **DeepSeek** | China | Unclear data handling | ❌ Avoid for sensitive content |
| **OpenAI** | US | Enterprise tier has strong privacy | ⚠️ Acceptable |

**Implementation pattern:**

```
User submission → Store locally with user_id
                         ↓
              Strip metadata, extract text only
                         ↓
              Batch submissions (every 6 hours)
                         ↓
              Shuffle batch order
                         ↓
              Send anonymous text[] to cloud LLM
                         ↓
              Receive structured PolicyCandidate[]
                         ↓
              Match results back to local submissions
                         ↓
              Store with audit trail
```

**Threat model acknowledgment**: Even anonymized political text in bulk could theoretically be valuable to adversaries, but it represents aggregate opinions without individual identification. The user-to-submission link is the critical secret, and that never leaves local infrastructure.

### 7.4 Why Approval Voting

| Mechanism | Comprehension | Strategic Resistance | Implementation |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Plurality** | Universal | Low | Trivial |
| **Approval** | High | Medium | Simple |
| **Ranked choice** | Medium | High | Complex |
| **Quadratic** | Low-Medium | Medium-High | Complex + needs credits |

**Decision**: Approval voting. Users understand it, implementation is simple, no vote-splitting problem.

### 7.5 Why Batch Clustering (not real-time)

- **Stability**: Clusters don't jump around as users watch
- **Efficiency**: Embedding computation is batched
- **Simplicity**: No complex incremental clustering logic
- **Audit**: Clear cycle boundaries in evidence store

**Tradeoff**: 6-hour delay between submission and cluster assignment. Acceptable for v0.

### 7.6 Why Public Analytics (no login wall)

- **Purpose**: Make collective will visible to everyone
- **Trust**: Transparency builds credibility
- **Reach**: Journalists, policymakers can cite without account
- **Safety**: Aggregated data doesn't expose individuals

### 7.7 Identity: Why No Phone Numbers

Per research: Iranian SIAM system uses phone numbers for surveillance. Platform must not require phone verification.

**What we use instead**:
- Email verification (magic links)
- Messaging account linking (account age is signal)
- Contribution-based trust (approved submissions unlock voting)

### 7.8 Coercion-Resistant Verification

**The problem**: In authoritarian contexts, users may be forced to prove how they voted or what they submitted. A verification system that lets users prove inclusion to themselves must not create transferable proof that a third party could demand.

**Design principles**:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Self-only verification** | Users can verify their submission/vote exists via their authenticated dashboard, but cannot export a standalone proof |
| **No transferable receipts** | Verification tokens are session-bound; they prove inclusion to the logged-in user, not to an arbitrary third party |
| **Timestamp obfuscation** | Submissions are batched and shuffled before processing; individual timing is not exposed in public views |
| **Plausible deniability** | Users can see aggregate results but cannot prove their individual contribution to an outside observer |

**What this means concretely**:
- The `/verify` endpoint requires authentication — no anonymous proof lookup
- The evidence store is public for aggregate chain integrity, but individual entries are keyed by internal IDs, not user-facing tokens
- Vote records are pseudonymous: users see their own votes in their dashboard, but cannot generate a shareable "I voted for X" certificate

**Tradeoff acknowledged**: This reduces transparency slightly (a user cannot independently prove to a journalist "my vote was counted"). We accept this tradeoff because coercion resistance is more important in the Iran context than third-party verifiability. External auditors can verify the aggregate chain without individual attribution.

## 8. What's In / Out of Scope

### In Scope (v0)

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| WhatsApp submission intake | Primary channel |
| Email verification | Magic links |
| Messaging account verification | Account age check |
| Canonicalization (LLM) | Cloud API (Anthropic/Mistral) with data separation |
| Clustering (HDBSCAN) | Batch every 6 hours |
| Approval voting | Via messaging app |
| Public analytics dashboard | Anyone can view |
| User dashboard | See own submissions/votes |
| Evidence store | Hash-chain in Postgres |
| Farsi + English UI | RTL support |
| Basic audit explorer | For technical users |

### Out of Scope (v0)

| Feature | Why Deferred |
|---------|-------------|
| Action execution | v0 is about visibility, not action |
| Telegram intake | Prove end-to-end flow with WhatsApp first; each additional channel multiplies verification complexity, abuse vectors, and maintenance overhead |
| Signal integration | Lower priority; add if demand |
| Quadratic/conviction voting | Start simple, iterate |
| Federation/decentralization | Single server sufficient for pilot |
| Blockchain anchoring | Optional; can add later |
| Mobile app | Website + messaging app sufficient |
| AI-generated translations | Start with human review |
| Demographic collection | Privacy concerns; add carefully later |
| Bridging algorithm | Can add after basic voting works |

## 9. Open Questions

### Must Resolve Before Build

1. **WhatsApp Business API access** — Need approved business account. What's the lead time? Cost? Alternatives if rejected? (Alternative: use Evolution API with Baileys for WhatsApp Web protocol)

2. **Evolution API deployment** — Self-hosted WhatsApp gateway. Docker setup, connection stability, reconnection handling.

3. **Cluster summary quality** — Need sample data to test. Where do we get realistic Farsi policy submissions for development?

### Can Resolve During Build

4. **Voting cycle timing** — Start with 48 hours, adjust based on participation patterns.

5. **Cluster granularity** — Start with `min_cluster_size=5`, tune based on feedback.

6. **Trust scoring weights** — Start simple (account age + contributions), refine with data.

### Can Resolve After Launch

7. **Optimal clustering frequency** — 6 hours to start; could go to real-time if needed.

8. **Translation strategy** — LLM auto-translate vs. human review vs. community edit.

9. **Demographic insights** — If/when/how to collect and display.
