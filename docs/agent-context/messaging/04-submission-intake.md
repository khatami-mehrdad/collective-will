# Task: Submission Intake Handler

## Depends on
- `messaging/03-webhook-endpoint` (message routing)
- `messaging/02-whatsapp-evolution-client` (WhatsAppChannel for sending confirmations)
- `database/03-core-models` (Submission model, User model, CRUD queries)
- `database/04-evidence-store` (append_evidence function)

## Goal
Implement the handler that receives a user's freeform text message and stores it as a submission, with evidence logging and user confirmation.

## Files to create

- `src/handlers/intake.py` — submission intake handler

## Specification

### handle_submission()

```python
async def handle_submission(
    message: UnifiedMessage,
    user: User,
    channel: BaseChannel,
    db: AsyncSession,
) -> None:
```

Steps:
1. **Check eligibility**: User must be verified (`email_verified=True` AND `messaging_verified=True`) AND account age >= `settings.min_account_age_hours` (default 48 in production). If not eligible, send a Farsi message explaining why and return.
2. **Check rate limit**: Query submissions by this user in the last 24 hours. If >= 5, send "limit reached" message and return.
3. **Run pre-persist PII screening**:
   - Detect high-risk personal identifiers in `message.text` (for example: phone numbers, emails, national IDs, exact addresses).
   - If high-risk PII is found: do not persist submission text. Send a Farsi prompt asking the user to remove PII and resend.
   - Log only a minimal evidence event (reason code/flags, no raw content).
4. **Store submission**:
   - Compute `hash = sha256(raw_text)`
   - Create Submission record: `user_id`, `raw_text=message.text`, `language` (detect later), `status="pending"`, `hash`
   - Save to database
5. **Log to evidence store**: Append `submission_received` event with payload `{submission_id, user_id, raw_text, hash, timestamp}`
6. **Send confirmation**: Via channel, send a Farsi message:
   ```
   ✅ دریافت شد! نظر شما ثبت شد.
   می‌توانید وضعیت آن را در وبسایت ببینید.
   ```
7. **Do not increment contribution_count here**: this handler stores raw submissions only. Contribution credit is added only after pipeline acceptance (`status="processed"`) or explicit policy endorsement.

### Hash computation

```python
import hashlib

def hash_submission(text: str) -> str:
    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

## Constraints

- Do NOT process or canonicalize the submission here. That happens in the pipeline module (batch, every 6 hours).
- Do NOT send the user's raw text to any external API in this handler.
- The user_id in the evidence store payload is the internal UUID, NOT the WhatsApp ID.
- If any step fails (DB write, evidence append), the submission should not be partially saved. Use a transaction.
- Keep this handler channel-agnostic: interact through `BaseChannel` only, never `WhatsAppChannel`-specific methods or payload assumptions.
- Do not hardcode `48` in handler logic; use config (`MIN_ACCOUNT_AGE_HOURS`) so tests can lower the threshold safely.
- `contribution_count` must not be incremented on intake; only accepted contributions (processed submissions or endorsements) count.
- High-risk PII submissions must not be stored as `raw_text`; users are asked to redact and resend.
- PII-detected rejection logs must not include the user's raw content.

## Tests

Write tests in `tests/test_handlers/test_intake.py` covering:
- Valid submission from verified user: submission stored, evidence logged, confirmation sent
- Unverified user (email not verified): submission rejected, appropriate message sent
- Unverified user (messaging not verified): submission rejected
- Account too young (< configured minimum): submission rejected
- With `MIN_ACCOUNT_AGE_HOURS=1` in test config, users older than 1 hour are accepted
- Rate limit: 5th submission accepted, 6th rejected with limit message
- High-risk PII detected: submission text is not stored; user receives redact-and-resend prompt
- PII-detection evidence event excludes raw submission content
- Submission hash is correct SHA-256 of raw_text
- Evidence log entry has correct event_type and payload
- User contribution_count is unchanged by intake (increment happens at acceptance/endorsement stage)
- Database transaction: if evidence append fails, submission is not saved (rollback)
- Mock the channel's send_message to verify confirmation message content
