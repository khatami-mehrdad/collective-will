# Task: Cluster Summarization and Agenda Builder

## Depends on
- `pipeline/01-llm-abstraction` (complete() with english_reasoning tier)
- `pipeline/05-hdbscan-clustering` (clusters exist with member candidates)
- `database/03-core-models` (Cluster, PolicyCandidate, PolicyEndorsement models)
- `database/04-evidence-store` (append_evidence)

## Goal
Generate human-readable summaries for each cluster using the quality-first `english_reasoning` model (v0 default: Claude Sonnet), then build the voting agenda using a multi-stage gate: size threshold first, endorsement-signature threshold second.

## Files to create

- `src/pipeline/summarize.py` — cluster summarization
- `src/pipeline/agenda.py` — agenda builder

## Specification

### summarize_clusters()

```python
async def summarize_clusters(
    clusters: list[Cluster],
    db: AsyncSession,
) -> list[Cluster]:
    """Generate summaries for clusters that don't have one yet."""
```

Steps:
1. For each cluster without a summary:
   - Load member PolicyCandidates
   - Prepare aggregated content: combine all member titles and summaries into one text block
   - Do NOT include individual submission IDs, user references, or metadata
   - Call `complete()` with `tier="english_reasoning"` and summarization prompt
   - Parse response into `summary` (Farsi) and `summary_en` (English)
   - If primary `english_reasoning` model fails after retries, use mandatory fallback (`english_reasoning_fallback_model`) and mark output with fallback metadata for audit/review
2. Update cluster records with summaries
3. Return updated clusters

### Summarization prompt

```
You are summarizing a group of related policy concerns from Iranian citizens.

The following policy positions were clustered together because they address similar concerns:

{aggregated_titles_and_summaries}

Write:
1. A concise summary (2-3 sentences) in Farsi that represents what this group collectively wants
2. An English translation of the same summary
3. A brief explanation (1 sentence) of why these items were grouped together

Output JSON:
{
  "summary_fa": "...",
  "summary_en": "...",
  "grouping_rationale": "..."
}
```

### build_agenda()

```python
async def build_agenda(
    cycle_id: UUID,
    db: AsyncSession,
    min_size: int = 5,
    min_endorsements: int = 5,
) -> list[UUID]:
    """Select clusters for voting. Returns list of cluster IDs."""
```

Steps:
1. Load all clusters for this cycle
2. Filter to clusters with `member_count >= min_size`
3. For remaining clusters, count distinct `PolicyEndorsement.user_id` signatures on each cluster
4. Keep only clusters with endorsement_count >= `min_endorsements`
5. Include ALL qualifying clusters — no editorial selection, no ranking, no filtering by topic
6. Log agenda-preparation evidence with qualifying/disqualified counts (the actual cycle_opened event is logged by the voting service)
7. Return the list of qualifying cluster IDs

### Cluster domain assignment

When summarizing, also verify/update the cluster's `domain` field based on the majority domain of its member candidates:

```python
def determine_cluster_domain(candidates: list[PolicyCandidate]) -> PolicyDomain:
    domain_counts = Counter(c.domain for c in candidates)
    return domain_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

## Constraints

- Only aggregated/anonymized content is sent to the LLM. Never individual submissions or user data.
- Ballot inclusion requires BOTH gates: size threshold and endorsement-signature threshold. No editorial filtering beyond these gates.
- Small clusters (below threshold) are NOT deleted. They remain visible on the analytics dashboard but don't appear in the voting ballot.
- Summary generation must always have a fallback path configured for risk management (`english_reasoning_fallback_model`).
- Keep provider/model choice behind `tier="english_reasoning"` only; this module must not hardcode provider model IDs.

## Tests

Write tests in `tests/test_pipeline/test_summarize.py` and `tests/test_pipeline/test_agenda.py` covering:

**Summarization:**
- Cluster with members gets a summary generated (mock LLM response)
- Cluster that already has a summary is skipped
- Aggregated text sent to LLM contains member titles/summaries but no user IDs (mock, inspect prompt)
- LLM returning invalid JSON: cluster flagged, no crash
- Summary stored in both Farsi and English fields
- Primary summary model failure triggers configured fallback model path

**Agenda:**
- Clusters with member_count >= 5 and endorsements >= threshold included in agenda
- Clusters with member_count < 5 excluded
- Clusters meeting size but missing endorsement threshold are excluded from ballot
- Empty cluster set returns empty agenda
- All qualifying clusters included (no filtering beyond size + endorsements)
- `determine_cluster_domain()` returns most common domain
- Domain tie-breaking is deterministic
