## Decision Alignment

- Keep HDBSCAN as primary clustering algorithm in v0.
- Apply cold-start guardrail via config-backed `min_cluster_size` per cycle.
- Keep unclustered/noise candidates visible in analytics rather than suppressing them.

## Decision: Keep HDBSCAN with explicit cold-start safeguards

**Why this is correct**

- HDBSCAN fits unknown-cluster-count problems and handles noise naturally.
- It avoids forcing all points into clusters, which improves trust in cluster quality.
- Running locally supports privacy and reproducibility goals.

**Risk**

- Sparse early cycles can produce mostly noise (few/no clusters) with strict thresholds.
- If unclustered items are hidden, users may think submissions were dropped.

**Guardrail**

1. Make `min_cluster_size` config/cycle driven (start at 3 early, move to 5 as volume matures).
2. Persist chosen clustering parameters in evidence metadata.
3. Surface unclustered candidates in analytics with clear explanation.

**Verdict**: **Keep with guardrail**
