# Contributing

This project is in the design phase. There is no code to run, no tests to pass, and no build system. The work right now is thinking, writing, and challenging assumptions.

## What Kind of Help Is Needed

**Challenge the design.** The docs contain open questions at the bottom of every section. If you have an opinion, experience, or a reference that's relevant — open an issue.

**Identify what's missing.** If you read a doc and think "this doesn't address X" — that's a contribution. File an issue describing the gap.

**Propose alternatives.** If you disagree with an approach (e.g., the clustering method, the voting mechanism, the decentralization timeline), write up your alternative and submit it as a PR or issue.

**Share prior art.** If you know of existing systems, papers, or projects that solve similar problems — or that tried and failed — share them. We'd rather learn from history than repeat it.

## How to Participate

1. **Read the docs.** Start from the [README](README.md) and follow the path that matches your interest.
2. **Open an issue** for questions, critiques, or ideas. A good issue title is a question, not a label. "How should the system handle multilingual submissions?" is better than "i18n."
3. **Submit a PR** if you want to propose changes to the design documents. Keep PRs focused — one idea per PR.

## Ground Rules

- **Substance over style.** Don't bikeshed formatting. Focus on whether the ideas are sound.
- **Steel-man, then critique.** If you disagree with something, show that you understand why it was proposed before arguing against it.
- **No implementation debates yet.** "Should we use Kafka or Postgres?" is premature. "What properties does the evidence store need?" is the right level of abstraction.
- **Open questions are invitations.** Every open question in the docs is explicitly asking for input. Start there if you're not sure where to begin.
