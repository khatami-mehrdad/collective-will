# Contributing

This project is transitioning from design to implementation. v0 scope is frozen (see [v0 Frozen Decisions](docs/mvp-specification.md#v0-frozen-decisions)). The work right now is building the MVP.

## What Kind of Help Is Needed

**Challenge the design.** The docs contain open questions at the bottom of every section. If you have an opinion, experience, or a reference that's relevant — open an issue.

**Identify what's missing.** If you read a doc and think "this doesn't address X" — that's a contribution. File an issue describing the gap.

**Propose alternatives.** If you disagree with an approach (e.g., the clustering method, the voting mechanism, the decentralization timeline), write up your alternative and submit it as a PR or issue.

**Share prior art.** If you know of existing systems, papers, or projects that solve similar problems — or that tried and failed — share them. We'd rather learn from history than repeat it.

## How to Participate

1. **Read the docs.** Start from the [README](README.md) and follow the path that matches your interest.
2. **Open an issue** for questions, critiques, or ideas. A good issue title is a question, not a label. "How should the system handle multilingual submissions?" is better than "i18n."
3. **Submit a PR** if you want to propose changes to the design documents. Keep PRs focused — one idea per PR.

## Ground Rules

- **Substance over style.** Don't bikeshed formatting. Focus on whether the ideas are sound.
- **Steel-man, then critique.** If you disagree with something, show that you understand why it was proposed before arguing against it.
- **Frozen decisions are frozen.** v0 scope, identity model, channel choice, infrastructure, and evidence store are locked. See [v0 Frozen Decisions](docs/mvp-specification.md#v0-frozen-decisions). To challenge a frozen decision, open an issue explaining why the decision should be revisited.
- **Open questions are invitations.** Every open question in the docs is explicitly asking for input. Start there if you're not sure where to begin.
